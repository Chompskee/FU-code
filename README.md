# FU-code
programming projects for SCAN master at Free University
This repository contains materials for a machine learning project for the Neurocognitive Methods and Programming course.
The code and data to create, train, and test the image classification model was obtained from https://www.datacamp.com (https://www.projects.datacamp.com/projects/509)
The data to validate the model was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet
I am just discovering Machine Learning and do not yet fully understand how to tune the hyperparameters to optimize the model(s).  However, I learned that with image classification, "categorical_crossentropy" is typically used for the loss function, "softmax" is typically used for the output layer of the model, and "ReLU" or 'rectified linear' is typically the activation function used in other layers.  I adjusted the model by changing the number of training epochs; I also tested the model with various optimizers, including "adam" and "sgd", neither of which performed better than the one used in the original code "rmsprop".
